    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest
    in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when
    Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
    Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
    Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
    action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned
    to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin II "Oakenshield"</h3>

        <p>
            Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in
            his youth, Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug,
            in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle
            of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's
            East-gate, and at some point in the battle, his shield broke, and, using an oaken tree branch found on
            the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which remained with him even in death.

        <h3>Kill and Fil</h3>

        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also nephews
            of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
            long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.
            As the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes, and were often sent scouting or searching. It
            was they that found the Front Porch while in the Misty Mountains.
            With the other Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli encountered spiders and were later imprisoned by the Elvenking
            Thranduil.They escaped the cells thanks to Bilbo, traveling down the river in barrels until they reached
            Lake-town.The brothers accompanied Thorin and Bilbo to Lake-town while the others rested by the
            river.
